Hi! I'm Claire. I'm a front-end developer interested in making accessible and interactive websites through clean and clever design.

I'm interested in working on a team with great and creative programmers and using my background in illustration and animation to create interactive and user-oriented websites. I love coding because it is both big-picture and all about the details; understanding and breaking down complex problems into bite-sized chunks.

In my spare time I am blacksmithing, drawing, or hanging out with my cats.</p>
